If you'd like to install `docker` from the official repos, please run this:
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaeedFazlollahzadeh/dciu/main/docker.sh | bash
```
If you'd like to install/update `docker-compose` from the github repo, please run this:
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SaeedFazlollahzadeh/dciu/main/docker-compose.sh | bash
```
Running `docker-compose.sh` script not also installs `docker-compose`, but also if installs, updates/upgrades too.

This supposes your `docker-compose` file is located at `/usr/bin/docker-compose`.
